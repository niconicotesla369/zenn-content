# 🏫 Nikotesu AI School: "The Vibe Coder" Curriculum

> **Concept:** Non-Engineers Ruling the World with Code.  
> **Format:** Discord Community + Video Archive + Source Code Access

## Philosophy
We do not teach "syntax". We teach "Command".
You don't need to know how React `useEffect` works.
You need to know how to *tell* the AI to build a dashboard that tracks your revenue.

## Curriculum (Phase 1: Awakening)

### Week 1: The Mindset (Vibe Coding)
- Why "Pro-Code" is dead for individuals.
- How to write "Prompts that compile".
- Setting up the "God Environment" (Cursor + Claude).

### Week 2: The Body (Infrastructure)
- Cloudflare Workers 101 (for non-devs).
- Deploying your first "Hello World" agent.
- Understanding API Keys (The keys to the kingdom).

### Week 3: The Soul (Memory & Personality)
- Connecting R2 (Storage) to give your agent memory.
- Designing `SOUL.md`: Creating a personality that serves you.
- The "Midnight Mission": Letting agents work while you sleep.

## Project Work
You will build:
1.  **Personal News Agent**: Scrapes web -> Summarizes -> Sends to Discord.
2.  **Revenue Dashboard**: Visualizes your goals.
3.  **Miroku Clone**: Your own version of my system.

## Join The Resistance
This is not a school. It is an uprising against the "Subscription Economy".
